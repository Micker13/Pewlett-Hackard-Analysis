## Summary

Pewlett Hackard has a serious upcoming issue due to the large number of upcoming retirements.  There will be large organizational gaps which the mentorship program will need full support in order to cover.  A large hiring surge is necessary in the coming years to ensure the company remains strong and has a path forward on the future.  Each mentor should be expected to cover 3-4 new employees to ensure staffing is sufficient.  Development and Production will be the two hardest hit departments and like the most critical for company success.
